# Climate Change Analysis in Wisconsin: A Multi-Station Study

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. This study focuses on analyzing climate patterns in Wisconsin, using data from four major weather stations across the state. Understanding local climate trends is crucial for adaptation and mitigation strategies.

### 1.2 Research Objectives
- Analyze long-term temperature trends in Wisconsin
- Examine changes in precipitation patterns
- Investigate seasonal temperature variations
- Study the frequency and intensity of heat waves

### 1.3 Research Questions
1. How has the annual mean temperature changed over the past decades?
2. Are there significant changes in annual precipitation patterns?
3. How have seasonal temperature patterns evolved?
4. Has there been an increase in heat wave frequency?

## 2. Data and Methods
### 2.1 Data Sources
Data was collected from four NOAA weather stations in Wisconsin:
- Madison Dane Co Regional Airport (USW00014837)
- Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport (USW00014898)
- Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport (USW00014920)
- Eau Claire Regional Airport (USW00014991)

### 2.2 Data Processing Methods
The analysis was conducted using Python, with the following key libraries:
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
- numpy for numerical computations

### 2.3 Analysis Methods
- Linear regression for trend analysis
- Seasonal decomposition
- Statistical analysis of extreme events
- Time series analysis for pattern identification

## 3. Results Analysis
### 3.1 Temperature Trends

The analysis of annual mean temperatures shows a clear warming trend across all four stations. Key findings include:
- A consistent increase in average annual temperature
- More pronounced warming in recent decades
- Greater temperature variability in winter months

### 3.2 Precipitation Patterns

The precipitation analysis reveals:
- Increasing annual precipitation totals
- More frequent extreme precipitation events
- Seasonal shifts in rainfall patterns

### 3.3 Seasonal Analysis

Seasonal temperature analysis shows:
- Winters warming faster than other seasons
- Extended growing seasons
- Less pronounced temperature differences between seasons

### 3.4 Heat Wave Analysis

Heat wave analysis indicates:
- Increased frequency of days above 30Â°C
- Longer duration of heat wave events
- More intense heat waves in urban areas

## 4. Discussion
### 4.1 Key Findings
1. Temperature trends show clear evidence of warming across Wisconsin
2. Precipitation patterns are becoming more variable and intense
3. Seasonal patterns show significant changes, particularly in winter
4. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense

### 4.2 Limitations
- Some data gaps in historical records
- Urban heat island effects may influence temperature readings
- Limited spatial coverage of weather stations
- Potential instrumentation changes over time

### 4.3 Future Research Directions
- Expand analysis to include more rural stations
- Investigate urban heat island effects
- Study correlation with large-scale climate patterns
- Analyze extreme weather events in more detail

## 5. Conclusion
This study provides strong evidence of climate change impacts in Wisconsin, characterized by warming temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. The findings highlight the need for continued monitoring and adaptation strategies at the local level.
